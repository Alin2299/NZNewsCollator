# NZ News Collator

## Overview
This project aims to collate articles associated with a range of New Zealand newspapers/news sites (such as Stuff and the NZ Herald) using RSS feeds
and then display them neatly/formatted on a page.

The project will incorporate Python, Node.js, HTML/CSS, MySQL, and basic Docker containerization and AWS integration.

In the future, this project may also include the ability to filter/select articles by topic (E.g Technology, Politics)
